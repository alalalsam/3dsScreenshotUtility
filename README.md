3dsScreenshotUtility
This program is basically just normal Luma3DS, except it takes a screenshot every couple seconds, for the purpose of building a large ml dataset. Credit for 99% of this work goes to the creators of Luma3ds, since I really only added like 2 files and 1 line of extra code in existing files.

based off of Luma3ds 13.1.1
idk if it even works yet maybe I'm getting ahead of myself editing the readme.

to use, download firmtool and the other program, add to path, and make using devkitPro.
